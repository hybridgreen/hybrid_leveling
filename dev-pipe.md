# ðŸ§± App Block Development Workflow (Modular Backend Projects)

A step-by-step guide to designing and building backend-powered app blocks in a modular, scalable way.

---

## 1. Define Core "Blocks" as Features or Domains

Treat each core area of your app like a separate domain:

| Block               | What It Manages                                      |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Training Plan       | Splits, periodization, schedules                     |
| Workout Log         | Strength/cardio sessions, metrics, notes             |
| Apnea Tracker       | COâ‚‚/Oâ‚‚ tables, breath-holds, mental state logging    |
| Stats & Insights    | Compliance rates, training load, trends              |
| User Preferences    | Time budget, goal, preferred days, restrictions      |

## 2. Use a Consistent Dev Pipeline for Each Block

Use this mini-pipeline to build blocks predictably:

| Stage            | Description                                         |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Concept**       | What problem does this block solve?                 |
| **Input/Output**  | What data goes in and comes out?                    |
| **Storage Model** | What gets stored? (DB tables, fields)               |
| **APIs**          | What endpoints or interfaces are needed?           |
| **Test Data**     | Create mock input/output scenarios                  |
| **Wire Up**       | Connect to app once stable                          |

## 3. Build Blocks in Isolation First

Avoid full app complexity by prototyping each block individually:

- Test core logic with static or fake data
- No need for full API or UI at this stage
- Keep output consistent for future use

## 4. Organize Code by Domain, Not Type

Instead of:

```
/models
/routes
/services
```

Use domain folders:

```
/training
  - models.py
  - routes.py
  - logic.py

/workouts
  - models.py
  - log.py

/apnea
  - routes.py
  - tables.py
```

## 5. Plan Visually with Tools

Recommended tools for whiteboarding and spec writing:

- **Excalidraw / Miro** â€“ system flow, logic, data flow
- **Notion / Obsidian** â€“ writing out scope, features, test data
- **dbdiagram.io** â€“ fast ERD sketching

## 6. Block Build Checklist

Use this checklist to develop any block:

- [ ] 1-paragraph scope statement
- [ ] Define inputs & outputs
- [ ] Consider edge cases
- [ ] Draft ERD (user â†’ block-specific entities)
- [ ] Create mock data in Markdown or JSON
- [ ] Build & test block in isolation
- [ ] Expose endpoint (e.g. `/api/split/`) once ready
